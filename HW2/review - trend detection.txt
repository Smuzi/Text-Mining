trend detection in social media

good introduction and preview of subjects to be discussed.

how do they recognize a trend and not just popular words?
how do they recognize the trend in real-time?
why only twitter and not general trend detection?
japanese team- event detection and not just trend
frequency of time stamp
time-series!

xiaoxu(the girl) didn't give enough time to read the slides.
---------------------
xiao(glasses &skinny) - talking to himself, not clear.

number of tweets > threshold

then adding authority weight (with relation to number of followers). 
what about users that are less followed than others but still affect more people? - covered.
not clear what nutrition and energy are - badly explained. (word aging)


-----------------------
quanua? (glasses&round) - better speaker

group hot words together  - good examples.

graph - and examples are good and effective.

PCA,SVD metrics - explanation? never heard of it.

specific elements in tweets - names/parties/places. 
grapevine to conduct large scale data - what is that?

links are important.
!!!!what about hashtags???? - user defined trends! how can they improve detection


--------------
yan (tall&glasses) - also pretty good

generate trends under different categories and then make trends more useful. 
billboard only? why not find what trends interested you in the past?
can trends appear in multiple categories??? the word mars can appear in science and in food for example.
